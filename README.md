===========================================

Case + Code Overview
--------------------
This repository is part of Real-Time Innovations' Case + Code project, a project
to create code for real-world RTI Connext DDS use cases.

This use case shows how RTI Connext DDS can be used to integrate the elements of
a microgrid in order to create an interconnected plug-and-play system that
executes a variety of microgrid use cases, including Islanding,
Resynchronization, and VF Handoff.

This use case example should be a stepping stone for creating real distributed
applications based on RTI Connext DDS. Additional information about this use
case can be found on [RTI's Case + Code page](https://www.rti.com/developers/case-code/).


RTI Connext DDS Overview
------------------------
RTI Connext DDS software includes the world's leading implementation of the
Object Management Group (OMG) Data Distribution Service (DDS). DDS is the only
open standard for messaging that supports the unique needs of both enterprise
and real-time systems. Its open interfaces and advanced integration capabilities
slash costs across a system's lifecycle, from initial development and
integration through on-going maintenance and upgrades. Visit the
